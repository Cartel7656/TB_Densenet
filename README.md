# Tuberculosis Detection Using DenseNet (with LIME & Grad-CAM Explainability)

This project implements a deep-learning–based tuberculosis (TB) detection system using DenseNet, trained on chest X-ray images. It includes a complete ML pipeline, a backend API, a frontend UI, and explainability tools such as LIME and Grad-CAM to visualize the model’s decision-making process.
